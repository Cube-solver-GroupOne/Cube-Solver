## Vision
Our software aims to learn by itself how to solve the cube challenge, depending on the power of (A.I). This idea came to reduce the number of moves that solve the cube in comparison with the human solution.

## Scope (In/Out)

#### In 
- The application will detect the Rubik's cube.
- The application will analyze the squares.
- The application will provide steps to solve the Rubik's cube.

#### Out

The prject will work only using python compiler (we should have compiler to run it like Pycharm or VScode ) and have a python python environment


## Minimum Viable Product vs

What will your MVP functionality be?

The Idea is to build bot that do a hard task.

What are your stretch goals?

1- Make the bot  able to upgrade during the time.
2- Achivce if possible , all machine learning concepts.

Stretch
What stretch goals are you going to aim for?

We are aim to make the bot usable if we have higher technology.
